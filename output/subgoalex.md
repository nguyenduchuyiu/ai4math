## Raw Code

```lean

theorem chain_example (a : Nat) : a = a := by
  have h1 : a = a := rfl
  have h2 : a = a := h1
  have h3 : a = a := sorry        -- unused
  have h4 : a = a := h2
  have h5 : a = a := h4
  exact h5

```

## Corrected Code

```lean
theorem chain_example (a : Nat) : a = a := by
  have h1 : a = a := rfl
  have h2 : a = a := h1
  have h3 : a = a := sorry -- unused
  have h4 : a = a := h2
  have h5 : a = a := h4
  exact h5
```

## Initial Verification
