### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. A function `f : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))`.
2. A hypothesis `h₁ : Fintype ↑(f ⁻¹' {0})` (this is a bit unusual because `f` is not necessarily a function from a finite set to a finite set, but Lean might interpret this as `f` being a function to a finite set, which is not the case here unless `f` is constant).
3. A real number `x` such that `f(x) = 0`, i.e., `x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0`.
4. The goal is to prove that `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`.

#### Observations:
1. The hypothesis `h₁` is suspicious because `f` is not a function to a finite set unless `f` is constant, but `f` is not constant (it depends on `x`). Moreover, `f` is not well-defined unless `x² + (18x + 45) ≥ 0`, which is true for all real `x` because the discriminant of `x² + 18x + 45` is `18² - 4*1*45 = 324 - 180 = 144 > 0`, so the quadratic is always positive. But Lean's `Real.sqrt` is only defined when the argument is non-negative, so `x² + (18x + 45) ≥ 0` is automatically true. However, Lean's `Real.sqrt` is a total function (returns `0` for negative inputs), but in our case, `x² + (18x + 45) ≥ 0` is always true because `x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 18 ≥ -18`, and `x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 18 ≥ -18` is not directly helpful. But in reality, `x² + (18x + 45) = x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 18 ≥ -18` is always true because `(x + 9)² ≥ 0`. So `x² + (18x + 45) ≥ -18`, but this doesn't help because the square root is still defined. 

But wait, Lean's `Real.sqrt` is defined for all real numbers, but the square root of a negative number is `0` in Lean (but mathematically undefined). However, Lean's `Real.sqrt` is defined as `Real.sqrt x = 0` when `x < 0`, so `√(x² + (18x + 45))` is always defined. 

But in our case, `x² + (18x + 45) ≥ 0` is always true because `x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 18 ≥ -18`, but `x² + 18x + 45 ≥ -18` is not directly helpful. 

But actually, `x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 18 ≥ -18`, but this is not directly relevant because `√(x² + (18x + 45))` is always defined. 

But the hypothesis `h₁` is strange because `f` is not a function to a finite set unless `f` is constant, but `f` is not constant. 

But perhaps `h₁` is a misinterpretation, and we can ignore it for now. 

#### Simplifying the Hypothesis `h_eq`:
We have `x² + (18x + 30) - 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0`. 

Rearrange this to:
`x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`. 

This is exactly the goal. 

#### Verification:
The hypothesis `h_eq` is `x² + (18x + 30) - 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0`, which is equivalent to `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`. 

This is because:
`x² + (18x + 30) - 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0` is equivalent to `x² + (18x + 30) = 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45))`. 

But `x² + (18x + 45) = x² + 18x + 45`, so the RHS is `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`. 

Thus, the goal is exactly the same as the hypothesis `h_eq`, so we are done. 

#### Conclusion:
The proof is straightforward: the goal is exactly the same as the hypothesis `h_eq`, so we can directly use it to close the goal. 

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Hypothesis `h_eq`**:
   - The hypothesis `h_eq` is `x² + (18x + 30) - 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0`.
   - Rearrange this to `x² + (18x + 30) = 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45))`.
   - Notice that `x² + (18x + 45) = x² + 18x + 45`, so the RHS is `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`.
   - Thus, the goal is exactly the same as `h_eq`, and we are done.

2. **Proof Sketch**:
   - The goal is `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`.
   - The hypothesis `h_eq` is `x² + (18x + 30) - 2 * √(x² + (18x + 45)) = 0`.
   - Rearrange `h_eq` to get the goal.

3. **Lean 4 Tactics**:
   - Use `linarith` or `ring_nf` to rearrange the hypothesis `h_eq` to the goal.

### Explanation:
- The `have` statement `h_main` directly corresponds to the goal, and its proof is straightforward from the hypothesis `h_eq` by rearranging terms. The actual Lean proof would simply use `linarith` or `ring_nf` to rearrange `h_eq` to the goal.

### Detailed Analysis and Proof

First, we need to understand the problem and the given hypotheses. We are given a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))`. The hypothesis `h₁ : Fintype ↑(f ⁻¹' {0})` is somewhat unusual because `f ⁻¹' {0}` is a set of real numbers, and `Fintype` is a typeclass that requires a finite type. However, `ℝ` is infinite, and `f ⁻¹' {0}` is a subset of `ℝ`, so this hypothesis seems incorrect unless `f` is restricted to a finite subset. But since `f` is defined on all of `ℝ`, this suggests that `f ⁻¹' {0}` might be finite. 

But the actual problem is simpler: we are given `hfx : f x = 0` and need to prove `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`. The hypotheses `h3` to `h6` are derived from `hfx` and the definition of `f`. 

#### Step 1: Understand the Hypotheses

1. `h3 : x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`
2. `h4 : x² + 18x + 45 ≥ 0`
3. `h5 : √(x² + 18x + 45)² = x² + 18x + 45` (which is always true by the property of square roots)
4. `h6 : (x² + 18x + 30)² = 4 * (x² + 18x + 45)`

Our goal is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

#### Step 2: Simplify `h6`

From `h6`, we can expand the left-hand side:
`(x² + 18x + 30)² = (x² + 18x + 30)² = x⁴ + 36x³ + 564x² + 1080x + 900`.

But we can also expand the right-hand side:
`4 * (x² + 18x + 45) = 4x² + 72x + 180`.

Thus, `h6` becomes:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 564x² + 1080x + 900 = 4x² + 72x + 180`.

Simplify:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 560x² + 1008x + 720 = 0`.

This seems complicated, but we can factor it. Notice that `x² + 18x + 20` is a factor of the polynomial on the left-hand side. 

#### Step 3: Factor the Polynomial

We can write the polynomial as:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 560x² + 1008x + 720 = (x² + 18x + 20)(x² + 18x + 36) + 0`.

This is incorrect, but we can find a better factorization. Alternatively, we can use the fact that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a root of the polynomial. 

But first, let's check if `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a solution. 

If `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`, then `x² + 18x = -20`, so:
`x² + 18x + 45 = -20 + 45 = 25`. 

Thus, `√(x² + 18x + 45) = √25 = 5`, and `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45) = 10`.

But `x² + 18x + 30 = -20 + 30 = 10`. 

Thus, `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)` becomes `10 = 10`, which is true. 

This suggests that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is indeed a solution. 

#### Step 4: Prove `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`

From `h6`, we have:
`(x² + 18x + 30)² = 4 * (x² + 18x + 45)`.

Let `y = x² + 18x + 30`. Then `h6` becomes `y² = 4 * (y + 15)`, i.e., `y² = 4y + 60`, or `y² - 4y - 60 = 0`.

Solve for `y`:
`y = (4 ± √(16 + 240)) / 2 = (4 ± √256) / 2 = (4 ± 16) / 2`, so `y = 10` or `y = -6`.

Thus, either `x² + 18x + 30 = 10` or `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`.

1. If `x² + 18x + 30 = 10`, then `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.
2. If `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`, then `x² + 18x + 36 = 0`, which gives `x = -9 ± 3√3`. 

But `x² + 18x + 36 = 0` would imply `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`, but we need to check consistency with `h3`:
`x² + 18x + 30 = -6` implies `x² + 18x + 45 = 9`, so `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 3`. 

But `h3` would then give `-6 = 2 * 3 = 6`, which is false. 

Thus, the second case is invalid. 

Therefore, the only valid solution is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

#### Step 5: Verification

We can verify that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a solution:
If `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`, then `x² + 18x = -20`, so `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, and `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 5`. 

Thus, `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45) = 10`, and `x² + 18x + 30 = -20 + 30 = 10`. 

Therefore, `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)` is satisfied. 

Hence, `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is indeed the solution.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute `y = x² + 18x + 30` into `h6` to get `y² = 4 * (y + 15)`.**
   - This gives `y² - 4y - 60 = 0`, which has solutions `y = 10` and `y = -6`.

2. **Case 1: `y = 10` (`x² + 18x + 30 = 10`).**
   - Then `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is the desired conclusion.

3. **Case 2: `y = -6` (`x² + 18x + 30 = -6`).**
   - This would imply `x² + 18x + 36 = 0`, but substituting back into `h3` leads to a contradiction (`-6 = 6`). Hence, this case is invalid.

4. **Conclusion:** The only valid solution is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

### Detailed Analysis and Proof

First, we need to understand the problem and the given hypotheses. We are given a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))`. The hypothesis `h₁ : Fintype ↑(f ⁻¹' {0})` is somewhat unusual because `f ⁻¹' {0}` is a set of real numbers, and `Fintype` is a typeclass that requires a finite type. However, `ℝ` is infinite, and `f ⁻¹' {0}` is a subset of `ℝ`, so this hypothesis seems incorrect unless `f` is restricted to a finite subset. But since `f` is defined on all of `ℝ`, this suggests that `f ⁻¹' {0}` might be finite. 

But the actual problem is simpler: we are given `hfx : f x = 0` and need to prove `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`. The hypotheses `h3` to `h6` are derived from `hfx` and the definition of `f`. 

#### Step 1: Understand the Hypotheses

1. `h3 : x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)`
2. `h4 : x² + 18x + 45 ≥ 0`
3. `h5 : √(x² + 18x + 45)² = x² + 18x + 45` (which is always true by the property of square roots)
4. `h6 : (x² + 18x + 30)² = 4 * (x² + 18x + 45)`

Our goal is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

#### Step 2: Simplify `h6`

From `h6`, we can expand the left-hand side:
`(x² + 18x + 30)² = (x² + 18x + 30)² = x⁴ + 36x³ + 564x² + 1080x + 900`.

But we can also expand the right-hand side:
`4 * (x² + 18x + 45) = 4x² + 72x + 180`.

Thus, `h6` becomes:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 564x² + 1080x + 900 = 4x² + 72x + 180`.

Simplify:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 560x² + 1008x + 720 = 0`.

This seems complicated, but we can factor it. Notice that `x² + 18x + 20` is a factor of the polynomial on the left-hand side. 

#### Step 3: Factor the Polynomial

We can write the polynomial as:
`x⁴ + 36x³ + 560x² + 1008x + 720 = (x² + 18x + 20)(x² + 18x + 36) + 0`.

This is incorrect, but we can find a better factorization. Alternatively, we can use the fact that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a root of the polynomial. 

But first, let's check if `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a solution. 

If `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`, then `x² + 18x = -20`, so:
`x² + 18x + 45 = -20 + 45 = 25`. 

Thus, `√(x² + 18x + 45) = √25 = 5`, and `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45) = 10`.

But `x² + 18x + 30 = -20 + 30 = 10`. 

Thus, `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)` becomes `10 = 10`, which is true. 

This suggests that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is indeed a solution. 

#### Step 4: Prove `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`

From `h6`, we have:
`(x² + 18x + 30)² = 4 * (x² + 18x + 45)`.

Let `y = x² + 18x + 30`. Then `h6` becomes `y² = 4 * (y + 15)`, i.e., `y² = 4y + 60`, or `y² - 4y - 60 = 0`.

Solve for `y`:
`y = (4 ± √(16 + 240)) / 2 = (4 ± √256) / 2 = (4 ± 16) / 2`, so `y = 10` or `y = -6`.

Thus, either `x² + 18x + 30 = 10` or `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`.

1. If `x² + 18x + 30 = 10`, then `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.
2. If `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`, then `x² + 18x + 36 = 0`, which gives `x = -9 ± 3√3`. 

But `x² + 18x + 36 = 0` would imply `x² + 18x + 30 = -6`, but we need to check consistency with `h3`:
`x² + 18x + 30 = -6` implies `x² + 18x + 45 = 9`, so `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 3`. 

But `h3` would then give `-6 = 2 * 3 = 6`, which is false. 

Thus, the second case is invalid. 

Therefore, the only valid solution is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

#### Step 5: Verification

We can verify that `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is a solution:
If `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`, then `x² + 18x = -20`, so `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, and `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 5`. 

Thus, `2 * √(x² + 18x + 45) = 10`, and `x² + 18x + 30 = -20 + 30 = 10`. 

Therefore, `x² + 18x + 30 = 2 * √(x² + 18x + 45)` is satisfied. 

Hence, `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is indeed the solution.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute `y = x² + 18x + 30` into `h6` to get `y² = 4 * (y + 15)`.**
   - This gives `y² - 4y - 60 = 0`, which has solutions `y = 10` and `y = -6`.

2. **Case 1: `y = 10` (`x² + 18x + 30 = 10`).**
   - Then `x² + 18x + 20 = 0` is the desired conclusion.

3. **Case 2: `y = -6` (`x² + 18x + 30 = -6`).**
   - This would imply `x² + 18x + 36 = 0`, but substituting back into `h3` leads to a contradiction (`-6 = 6`). Hence, this case is invalid.

4. **Conclusion:** The only valid solution is `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

### Detailed Solution and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
- We have a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))`.
- We are given that `x = -9 + √61` and must prove that `f(x) = 0`.
- The additional hypotheses about `Fintype` and `f ⁻¹' {0}` are irrelevant to the actual goal (`f x = 0`), so we can ignore them.

#### Step 1: Simplify the Expression Inside the Square Root
Notice that the expression inside the square root is `x² + (18x + 45)`:
```
x² + (18x + 45) = x² + 18x + 45.
```
We can complete the square for this quadratic in `x`:
```
x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 36.
```
But this doesn't seem immediately helpful. Instead, let's compute `x² + 18x + 45` for `x = -9 + √61`:
```
x² + 18x + 45 = (-9 + √61)² + 18(-9 + √61) + 45
              = (81 - 18√61 + 61) - 162 + 18√61 + 45
              = (142 - 18√61) - 162 + 18√61 + 45
              = (142 - 162 + 45) + (-18√61 + 18√61)
              = (25) + 0 = 25.
```
Thus, `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, and `√(x² + 18x + 45) = √25 = 5`.

#### Step 2: Compute `f(x)` Using the Simplified Square Root
Now, we can compute `f(x)`:
```
f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))
     = x² + 18x + 30 - 2 * 5
     = x² + 18x + 30 - 10
     = x² + 18x + 20.
```
But we already know that `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, so `x² + 18x = -20`. Substituting this into `f(x)`:
```
f(x) = (x² + 18x) + 20 = -20 + 20 = 0.
```

#### Step 3: Verification
Alternatively, we can directly compute `x² + 18x + 20` using `x = -9 + √61`:
```
x² + 18x + 20 = (-9 + √61)² + 18(-9 + √61) + 20
              = (81 - 18√61 + 61) - 162 + 18√61 + 20
              = (142 - 18√61) - 162 + 18√61 + 20
              = (142 - 162 + 20) + (-18√61 + 18√61)
              = (0) + 0 = 0.
```

Both approaches confirm that `f(x) = 0`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Compute `x² + 18x + 45`**:
   - Substitute `x = -9 + √61` and simplify to get `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`.

2. **Simplify `f(x)`**:
   - Use the result from step 1 to get `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 5`.
   - Substitute this into `f(x)` to get `f(x) = x² + 18x + 20`.

3. **Compute `x² + 18x + 20`**:
   - Substitute `x = -9 + √61` and simplify to get `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

4. **Conclude `f(x) = 0`**.

### Detailed Solution and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
- We have a function `f : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))`.
- We are given that `x = -9 + √61` and must prove that `f(x) = 0`.
- The additional hypotheses about `Fintype` and `f ⁻¹' {0}` are irrelevant to the actual goal (`f x = 0`), so we can ignore them.

#### Step 1: Simplify the Expression Inside the Square Root
Notice that the expression inside the square root is `x² + (18x + 45)`:
```
x² + (18x + 45) = x² + 18x + 45.
```
We can complete the square for this quadratic in `x`:
```
x² + 18x + 45 = (x + 9)² - 36.
```
But this doesn't seem immediately helpful. Instead, let's compute `x² + 18x + 45` for `x = -9 + √61`:
```
x² + 18x + 45 = (-9 + √61)² + 18(-9 + √61) + 45
              = (81 - 18√61 + 61) - 162 + 18√61 + 45
              = (142 - 18√61) - 162 + 18√61 + 45
              = (142 - 162 + 45) + (-18√61 + 18√61)
              = (25) + 0 = 25.
```
Thus, `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, and `√(x² + 18x + 45) = √25 = 5`.

#### Step 2: Compute `f(x)` Using the Simplified Square Root
Now, we can compute `f(x)`:
```
f(x) = x² + (18x + 30) - 2√(x² + (18x + 45))
     = x² + 18x + 30 - 2 * 5
     = x² + 18x + 30 - 10
     = x² + 18x + 20.
```
But we already know that `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`, so `x² + 18x = -20`. Substituting this into `f(x)`:
```
f(x) = (x² + 18x) + 20 = -20 + 20 = 0.
```

#### Step 3: Verification
Alternatively, we can directly compute `x² + 18x + 20` using `x = -9 + √61`:
```
x² + 18x + 20 = (-9 + √61)² + 18(-9 + √61) + 20
              = (81 - 18√61 + 61) - 162 + 18√61 + 20
              = (142 - 18√61) - 162 + 18√61 + 20
              = (142 - 162 + 20) + (-18√61 + 18√61)
              = (0) + 0 = 0.
```

Both approaches confirm that `f(x) = 0`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Compute `x² + 18x + 45`**:
   - Substitute `x = -9 + √61` and simplify to get `x² + 18x + 45 = 25`.

2. **Simplify `f(x)`**:
   - Use the result from step 1 to get `√(x² + 18x + 45) = 5`.
   - Substitute this into `f(x)` to get `f(x) = x² + 18x + 20`.

3. **Compute `x² + 18x + 20`**:
   - Substitute `x = -9 + √61` and simplify to get `x² + 18x + 20 = 0`.

4. **Conclude `f(x) = 0`**.
